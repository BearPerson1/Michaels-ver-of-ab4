* N*Sync is a utility application targeted at NUS students, to simplify some of their daily routines such as arranging a common timeslot with friends, and downloading their notes from IVLE.
* As a Java application, it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but most of the user interactions happen through a Command Line Interface (CLI).
