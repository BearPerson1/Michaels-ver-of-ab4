== [blue]#PROJECT: NSync#

== [blue]#Overview#
NSync is a student lifestyle management and utility application built apon AddressBook - Level 4.  The user interacts
with it using a Command-Line interface with a graphic user interface created with JavaFX. It also implements Selenium
chrome Driver to operate web interactions.

== [blue]#Summary of contributions#
* *Major Enhancement* : added ability to download notes from IVLE automatically.


** What it does: allows the user to download all notes of a certain module using the `downloadAllNotes` command
as well as view all the available files and select which files to download with the `downloadSelectNotes` command.

** Justification: This feature will allow the user to save significant amount of time each week, by simplifying the
the download of all the files of all the modules to a couple of lines of input.

** Highlights: It uses the extremely flexible Selenium Webdriver library. With this existing library included, we would
be able to implement other features that implement with the web: Going through Emails etc.

** Credits: Selenium WebDriver.


* *Minor Enhancement* :  added the ability to view the notes download using the `showNotes`

* *Code contributed* : [https://github.com/BearPerson1/Michaels-ver-of-ab4[Functional Code]]

** Project management:
*** Implemented auto extraction of ChromeDrivers from the .jar.
*** Implemented auto creation of additional file paths from .jar.

** Documentation:
*** Added entries to the User Guide for `downloadAllNotes`,`downloadSelectNotes` and `showNotes` command.

** Tools:
*** Integrated third party library (apache.commons.io) to project
*** Integrated third party library (selenium) to project
