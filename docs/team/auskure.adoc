This portfolio showcases my ability to produce functional code and documentation, for a team-based NUS
 software engineering project.

== PROJECT: NSync

---

== Overview

NSync is a desktop-based utility application used by NUS students, with tailored tools for timetable
coordination and notes acquisition, allowing for streamlining of work processes.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Notes Deletion
** What it does: In a single command, we allow the user to delete the notes he has downloaded using
 NSync.  This helps him quickly and conveniently free up storage space.
** Justification: Because my teammate has already implemented an automated notes downloader, allowing
the user to download large folders conveniently, it is also useful to have an equally convenient method
to delete notes.  This removes the need for the user to manually go to storage to delete his own
notes.
** Highlights: As this enhancement involves interaction with actual storage, a good understanding of
how `Model` and `Storage` components work together, is required.
Existing file manipulation libraries such as java.io and java nio libraries were incorporated into this
enhancement.

* *Minor enhancement*: Alphabetised contact list in the address book.
** What it does: When you add a new contact to your contact list, the contact is added in an alphabetic
 order automatically.  This is opposed to the original implementation, which simply appends the new
 contact to the end of the list.
** Justification:  This makes the contact list appear more organized.
 Contacts are alphabetised as they should be.
** Highlights: This enhancement worked very closely with the graphical user interface javafx.  As such
an understanding of how javafx works is required.  For the sorting algorithms, we made use of existing
library java.util.

* *Minor enhancement*: File Unzipping
** What it does: As a supporting enhancement to the notes download enhancement, file unzipping helps to
 unzip downloaded notes. We make things more intuitive for the user, by automatically storing
  unzipped files according to the modules they belong to.
** Justification: IVLE's libraries downloads files in a zip format.  Automatically unzipping
 and storing the files saves the user's time.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an add on to the main enhancement, download notes.  To allow the user
to achieve a seamless experience, it is important to work together as a team.  A deep understanding of the main enhancement, download notes,
is required.  We made use of existing library java.io, java.nio, and java.util.zip, as well as
modified and improved upon extracting zip files online tutorials.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Successfully assigned and managed `issues` for all team members, and matched them to corresponding deadlines.
*** Effectively planned and facilitated discussions on project direction and work delegation.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Added a new attribute to the Person Class, called Enrolled Modules.  This allows you to learn with just one glance,
what modules your contact is taking.

** Documentation:
*** Performed updates and organized the User Guide into a more reader friendly format, in pull request
https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W12-2/main/pull/61[#61]

** Community:
*** Pull requests reviewed with elaborate comments in pull request
