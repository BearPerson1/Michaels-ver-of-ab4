== PROJECT: NUSync

---

== Overview

NUSync is an utility application that consists of a timetable manager, as well as an all in one IVLE notes downloader.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: IVLE Notes downloader
** What it does: Allows the user to select and download all/selected notes


** Justification: Allows the user to download his or her notes with a single line of command. Additionally, allow the users to download a single file with at most 2 lines of command. This method significantly triumphs the existing method; which involves manually transversing the IVLE web page, in terms of efficiency.


** Highlights: This is a completely new feature that has been added into the existing AddressBook level 4 code base. It does not improve on any existing feature at the moment.
** Credits: Selenium Web driver.

* *Minor enhancement*: Allow the user to select a few files instead of all the files to download.
