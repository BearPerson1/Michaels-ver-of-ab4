== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 4

---

== Overview
NSync was designed to streamline the average NUS student's life by automating notes downloads and aiding in meeting scheduling by
automating the search for common free time slots between contacts. NSync is a desktop application that uses a command
 line interface.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Schedule synchronizer.
** What it does: It allows a user to store timetables in the address book. Users can then
create a group timetable with a contact/multiple contacts in the address book
that displays all common free time slots and how many people are busy at each time slot if it is not free. This
group contact is stored in a separate list from the individual contact for easier identification.
 It also allows the user to automatically update their group timetables based on any changes to their contacts by
 inputting
update.
** Justification: This will allow users to easily find a time slot to arrange for meet ups for social or work related
 reasons because finding a common time slot can be an annoying experience when it involves too many people. It also
 ensures that keeping it updated is not a hassle and a person will not have to manually update his groups every time
 a change is made to one of their contacts's timetable or a contact is deleted.
** Highlights: To be decided.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Contacts can be filtered based on their free time slots or activities present in their
timetable or enrolled modules that they have.
